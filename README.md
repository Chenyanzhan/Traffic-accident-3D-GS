# Traffic-accident-3D-GS
This study proposes a novel virtual-real-fusion simulation framework that integrates traffic accident generation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based image collection and a 3D traffic accident reconstruction pipeline with advanced computer vision techniques and unsupervised 3D point clouds clustering algorithms.
